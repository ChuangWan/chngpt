    * add set.seed(1) to chngpt.score.test so that the results are
    reproducible
    * rename chngpt.score.test to chngpt.test
	* MASS is used for generating reference distribution samples while mvrnorm
	is used in sim.sigmoid. In principle, should be able to use a single
	package, but since the simulation studies for the paper has already been
	run, just leave it as it is
	* let search.all.thresholds be true if n < 500
