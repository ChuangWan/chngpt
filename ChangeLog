    * create package

2013-08-14  V_0.1-2 Youyi Fong

    * add set.seed(1) to chngpt.score.test so that the results are
    reproducible
    * rename chngpt.score.test to chngpt.test
    * MASS is used for generating reference distribution samples while mvrnorm
    is used in sim.sigmoid. In principle, should be able to use a single
    package, but since the simulation studies for the paper has already been
    run, just leave it as it is
    * let search.all.thresholds be true if n < 500

    * when glm warns, set the log likelihood to NA

2015-09-29  Youyi Fong

    * implement more vcov
    * add e.effective.maxit to deal with non-convergence

    * when est.method==smoothapprox, effective chgnpt needs to be determined
	to stop infinite loops. It used to be defined in between two observed data
	values, but is not set to one observed data value

    * make.chngpt.var now takes b. as an argument, the results of smoothapprox
	estimation will change!

2016-01-24  Youyi Fong

    * add testing for linear model

2017-05-13  Youyi Fong

    * modify make.chngpt.var to fit smooth transition model
	* add sandwich variance estimator
	* add segmented2
	* change b to -b

    * this version contains some commented out code related to indices, which
	was used to compare with R implemention
